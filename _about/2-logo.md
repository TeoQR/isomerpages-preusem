The neural network, supported by a diversity of cells necessary for the functioning of the body, represents Singapore’s digital-connectedness and human-centeredness in propelling the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

Every one of the 22 red dots within the futuristic outline of the Singapore map represents an idea, a dream, a theory of each of the 22 groups of participants from diverse backgrounds that have come together to envision our nation’s future. The connecting lines show the unity of minds in their attempt to bring Singapore forward in today’s volatile climate that is packed with limitless possibilities.

The 50 facets symbolise 50 years of Pre-University Seminar, an annual event that provides participants a platform to discuss Singapore’s opportunities and challenges in creating a forward-looking nation.
