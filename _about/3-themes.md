### **Main theme:**
### **Singapore 4.0: What Next?**

The Pre-University Seminar offers the leaders of tomorrow, our youths, the opportunity to engage in the process of self-examination and envisioning as they prepare to navigate a future world that will be shaped significantly by the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), currently in its nascent stage. 

In his 2018 National Day Rally speech, PM Lee also spoke about ‘major shifts in our external environment’ and the need for us to plant the seeds now so that we may ‘give ourselves the best chances of success’ whatever the future brings. 

It is against such a backdrop that the theme is proposed for Pre-University Seminar 2019. This theme directs the participants’ attention to the 4IR as it continues to unfold, and the role of technology in shaping the future. Participants will be challenged to consider what such a future may hold for Singapore, what we can do to leverage opportunities and mitigate the trade-offs, how we can continue to strengthen our unique identity in the world, and stay rooted to our values.

#### **Sub-Themes:**

Participants will explore the future of Singapore across three broad sub-themes: **‘Live and Learn’**; **‘Work and Play’** and **‘Strengthen and Secure’**. 

These sub-themes are divided into 22 areas of focus. In each area of focus, participant would, in their research and activities, consider the following:

a. the opportunities that the future presents; 

b. the attendant challenges and/or the trade-offs; 

c. how Singapore can address these challenges and/or trade-offs; and 

d. the shared values that can guide and anchor us as we navigate the changing world.
