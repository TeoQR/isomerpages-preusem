### **Objectives**

The Pre-University Seminar is the annual platform for students from different educational institutions to come together to achieve a better understanding of issues relevant to Singapore’s progress. Pre-University Seminar 2019 is a milestone seminar as it is the 50th seminar to be organised since its inception in 1970. It is timely for its participants to celebrate, and reflect on issues relevant to Singapore’s progress from the past to the present. Pre-University Seminar 2019 provides a platform for the participants to envision a future for Singapore which, despite current geopolitical tensions and rapid technological changes, thrives in its vision of building an inclusive society with opportunities for all. 

The objectives of Pre-University Seminar 2019 are: 

a. to raise participants’ awareness of Singapore’s opportunities and challenges in creating a forward-looking nation; 

b. to enable participants to gain new perspectives on diverse issues through research, discussions, experiential learning and interaction with people from different backgrounds, expertise and experiences; 

c. to encourage participants to have deep conversations among themselves and reflect on their shared aspirations for Singapore; and 

d. to nurture teamwork and camaraderie among participants across institutions.
